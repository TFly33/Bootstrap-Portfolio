                        I'm a 31 year old living in Center City, Philadelphia with my wife and two dogs.
                        I grew up in Chicago, Frankfurt Germany, and Northern Virginia.
                        I played Division 1 baseball at Mount Saint Mary's University in Emmitsburg, Maryland from
                        2007-2011 (<a

                            my
                            bio</a>).
                        Once I realized I couldn't hit a curveball and wouldn't make it as a pro, I decided to go to
                        law
                        school. I graduated from George Mason School of Law in 2014. I'm barred to practice law in
                        both Virginia
                        and Pennsylvania.

                        I've worked in International Aviation Law (I know, random) and currently am an associate

                        working in
                        real estate law.
                        I also have some startup experience. I was the first hire at a youth sports sponsorship
                        startup
                        in
                        Philly and

                        people

                        I'm also an obsessive hobbyist. I am a part-time professional poker player, a Class-A chess

                        (<a href="https://medium.com/@tfly.flynn">here are some articles from the past</a>). I'm
                        always
                        looking to
                        meet new people and experience new things.
